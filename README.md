## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
​
This is just a retro game online, so that means that you are able to play Lan wise with a friend for some Co-op gameplay.
​
* Users interested in retro gaming 
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
We have a Blue background which consist of a Blue #0000ff color. This includes the columns as well as to make everything match.
We have a open rounded border circle which has the color #fff as to be completly white inside the blue box.

For the playing chip we have Red #ff0000 and Yellow #ffff00. These are meant to shift between the two color whenever you click once and twice.

Then there are similar colors on the names for each player corresponding correct color.

​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**

#### *features
​
Its four in a row. You're able to play in a lan motion with someone else on the same computer, you can win in any direction aslong as you get 4 in a row. The features are that it automatically adds score points to the corresponding person depending if Red or Yellow wins. There is also a Draw which would then just reset the game without giving anyone points.

Most features are simple, you click on one color. And then you click on another empty space, The game will calculate how many colors there are in a row and when there is 4 given the game will end and a new will start. If there is no winners the game will Draw and neither will get a point and it will just restart.
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
Online mode, so you can play online with other people and pottentially add an AI into the game you can play against using random number generator.
​
## **Testing Phase**
​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through

* The testing phase would be solved by basically playing the game over and oveer.
​
* Its responsive elements are working, it doesn't lag out as to say and it remains a nice funcion and works on both Mobile, tablet and PC.
​
* The Java script follows command fully.

​
## **Bugs**
​
None that I know of. The game seems to be running fine without causing any sort of bugs.

## **Bugs I had**

* Couldn't manage to figure out how to make it 'draw' as whenever I drawed it gave a point to the Yellow team.
